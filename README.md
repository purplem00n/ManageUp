# ManageUp
iOS App for tracking career successes

# Description
Stressed out writing your annual self-evaluation? Want to advocate for a promotion or raise but aren't sure if you've done enough? Struggling with imposter syndrome and need to be reminded of how capable you are?

Manage Up is the place where you can document your accomplishments as you go, and see it all in one place when the time comes to self-advocate.

Create an account and make an entry with tags to categorize your objectives. For example, is this a Q3 goal you're working towards, is this an example of how you work well on a team, or take a leadership role, or a summary at the end of a big project? You'll be able to see all your entries by date, or search by tag to see just those entries.

# Roadmap for Future Features
Summarize:
Run a subset of entries through an AI summary query.

Add Attachments:
Attach an email with kudos from your boss, or a link to or screenshot of a file you've been working on.

Time Tracking:
Possible integration with an existing browser extension or pomodoro app, or manual entry that tracks your time and the ability to add comments in a "what I produced" section - to track how much time is allocated to which work responsibilities or career related activities, and what you've been able to accomplish in that time. A summarize button could aggregate the amount of hours you've spent on each activity for a given time period. Zero hours networking last quarter? Prioritize getting that in!

Reminders:
Some way to integrate prompts; to be able to create reminders to be specific, and what to include: both for better recall and for better summarization. I would hope to include some reminders about common interview questions or self evaluation questions, so that it becomes easy and natural to think of and recall examples of how you exemplify the qualities you're asked about.
